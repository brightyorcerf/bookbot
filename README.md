BookBot:
A real-world command-line application built in Python for text analysis. 
This tool processes entire novels to generate data reports on word and character frequency.

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Phase 1: Setup
Local Python environment
Git repository integration
GitHub project hosting

Phase 2: Data Analysis
Read text files from the local filesystem
Calculate total word count
Analyze frequency of every character using Python dictionaries

Phase 3: The Report
Format raw data into a clean terminal report
Build command-line tooling for any .txt file
